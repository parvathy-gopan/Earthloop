## How it Works?
EarthLoop is a comprehensive waste management solution designed to transform rural sustainability. Our project works by providing a subscription-based waste management service that includes waste collection, segregation, recycling, and responsible disposal. Users can subscribe to EarthLoop through our mobile app and schedule waste pickups right at their doorstep. The collected recyclable materials are then sold to local vendors to contribute to the circular economy. Through data-driven insights and an incentive program, EarthLoop encourages users to reduce waste and increase recycling efforts.
